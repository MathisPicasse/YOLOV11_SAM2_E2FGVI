# ðŸŽ¬ Video Inpainting Pipeline + Script to convert MOTchallenge format dataset to YOLO format

End-to-end pipeline for **video people removal** combining **YOLO (object detection)**, **SAM (segmentation)**, and a **E2FGVI**.  
The goal: detect and segment objects in a video, mask them, and reconstruct the missing areas frame by frame.
